          <p>
            I design and develop high-quality, interactive web applications with a focus on performance, usability, and aesthetics. Proficient in React, JavaScript, SASS, and Rails, I build responsive, user-friendly interfaces that enhance digital experiences.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the past five years, Iâ€™ve expanded my expertise in frontend and backend development, collaborating with developers worldwide and contributing to diverse projects. This journey has sharpened not just my technical skills, but also my communication, teamwork, and project management abilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            I thrive on continuous learning and embracing new challenges. Whether it's refining a UI component, optimizing performance, or diving into a new tech stack, I'm always eager to grow and push boundaries.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy intellectual debates, football (soccer), and working on projects that empower developers. If you have an exciting project or a freelance opportunity, feel free to reach outâ€”Iâ€™d love to collaborate! ðŸ˜Š
